    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    Most of this code was provided for me already. I completed the Q training model that ran in a loop for the given number of epochs. 
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        Computer scientists explore new methods of using software to solve problems. This can mean a refinement of existing technologies or the emergence of entirely new ones. In the context of this course, computer scientists use AI to create systems that have the ability to draw insights from vast amounts of unstructured data, make existing processes more efficient, or even surpass human abilities. 
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        My approach to a problem is to first clearly outline it. A clear definition of the problem allows for a clear definition of what a solution looks like. Then, I can identify the tools that would be best suited to that particular problem. While AI may help us solve many problems, it is not effective to use it as the solution to every problem. 
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        I believe that I have to provide a product to the end user that will not negatively affect them or others physically, mentally, financially, or socially. I have a responsibility to my organization to implement this belief in all my work and report/remediate any violations of them.
